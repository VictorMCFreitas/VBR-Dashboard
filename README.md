VBR Dashboard is a dashboard to be used in SimHub to help simracers get the info needed to improve their racing skills. This is an evolution of my previous VBR Leaderboard. Changed the name to VBR Dashboard because it now includes a Dashboard screen with many info. Make it compatible with iRacing showing iRatings of the players.

The Dashboard has 3 parts:

1. **HEADER**
   
With **Name** of the track that is running, **Number** of Laps or **Time** left to the ending, **Time** of the computer

3. **BOTTOM**

With **Tyre temperature**, **Tyre Wear**, **Tyre Pressure**, **Flag** (if there is a flag in the race), **Fuel Remaining**, **Fuel per Lap**, **Fuel Last Lap**, **Remaining Laps**, **Air Temperature**, **Track Temperature**

3. **CENTER**

The Center of the Dashboard is composed of 4 screens that can be changed with the definition of key A in SimHub.

3.1. **SPLASH** Screen

The Splash Screen will show the game that is running (iRacing, Assetto Corsa Competizione, Assetto Corsa, Automobilista 2, RaceRoom, Rfactor 2)

3.2. **DASHBOARD** Screen

The Dashboard Screen shows the info of the status of the car and its settings. It has 2 variants, this one is for iRacing and has info of iRatings in the bottom left of the screen

This screen is dynamic. It will always show 10 lines of times. The first 3 are from the first 3 positions of players. The next 7 are displayed in such a way that a maximum of 3 players before and 3 after are always visible, It has also 2 variants. One for iRacing with iratings info and other for non-iRacing games.
